        <h2>Ingredients needed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of salted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp of dried or fresh parsley</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a large pan on the stove at medium/low heat.</li>
            <li>While the pan's heating - crack your 5 eggs into a bowl. Check for any bits of egg shell and remove them.</li>
            <li>Add ground salt and pepper to taste and the 1/2 tbsp of parsley.</li>
            <li>With the pan sufficiently heated, add your 1 tbsp of salted butter. Add more butter as necessary to evenly coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk together your egg mixture until the egg white and yolk are homogeneous. Then pour onto pan.</li>
            <li>When the edges of the eggs start to turn white, begin stirring and folding the eggs with a spatula.</li>
            <li>As the eggs begin to thicken and solidify it becomes more important to stir and flip them.</li>
            <li>With the eggs solid but still slightly runny, take them off the heat, but keep them in the pan. Use the residual heat of the pan to cook them just enough to your desired texture</li>
            <li>Top with freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>You're done! enjoy your soft and delicious scrambled eggs!</li>
