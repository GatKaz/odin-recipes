        <h5><em>Freshly popped popcorn in a bowl</em></h5>
        <p>Everybody loves that classic buttery and salty taste popcorn from the theater is known for. What most people don't know is how easy and cheap it is to make at home.</p>
        <p>Here's a recipe for theater style popcorn that can be done with 3 ingredients at home with a simple lidded pot on the stove. The ingredients are not only easy to find but are also the exact ones used at the movie theater.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients Needed:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>High smoke point oil like refined coconut oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp of Flavacol</li>
            <li>200g popcorn kernels</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Clarified butter/Ghee</li>
            <li>Additional spices or popcorn flavors</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Place a lidded pot onto your stovetop and set the heat just below medium/5. Add enough oil to completely cover the bottom.</li>
            <li>After any solid pieces of oil have completely melted, add 4 unpopped kernels to the pot.</li>
            <li>After all 4 kernels have popped start pouring in the rest until the bottom is just barely covered. Add the flavacol but be careful if you didn't add all your popcorn kernels, it's very easy to overdo the flavacol so less is more. Now add any additional <strong>dry</strong> flavorings or spices. Once everything's added vigorously shake the pot to evenly coat the kernels.</li>
            <li>A short minute or two later the kernels will start popping. Lightly shake the pot to move any unpopped kernels to the bottom to prevent burning. Depending on how tall your pot is you may need to empty out some popcorn into a bowl, simply open the lid slightly and shake some popcorn out.</li>
            <li>When you notice the popping slow down start lowering the heat. You can empty more of the pot into a bowl to see how many unpopped kernels are left. To prevent burning empty the pot completely if only a few kernels remain.</li>
            <li>Toss your popcorn in a bowl with any <strong>wet</strong> toppings (like butter) and flavacol if needed.</li>
            <li>Your popcorn's now ready to enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
