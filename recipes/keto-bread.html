        <h5><em>Several cut slices of keto bread</em></h5>
        <p>Here's a tasty keto bread recipe that's high on protein, fiber and with only a few grams on sugar needed for the yeast. Great to eat toasted or used in a sandwich.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients needed</h2>
        <h4><strong>WET</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>7g instant yeast</li>
            <li>7g sugar</li>
            <li>350ml warm water (43 celsius)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>DRY</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>125g ground gold flax seed</li>
            <li>175g vital wheat gluten</li>
            <li>100g oat fiber</li>
            <li>7g salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>We'll start with the dry ingredients first. If you opted for whole gold flax seeds now's the time to grind it. The finer the grind for your flax the better the bread's texture.</li>
            <li>In your stand mixer's bowl or normal mixing bowl add your ground flax seed, vital wheat gluten, salt and oat fiber. Be careful adding the oat fiber, it's a <strong>very</strong> fine powder thats easy to get everywhere if you send it straight into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Lightly whisk the dry mixture until everything's incorporated.</li>
            <li>Now in a separate warmed up bowl, add your water, sugar and yeast and stir until mostly dissolved. A few visible chunks of yeast is fine.</li>
            <li>Wait about 5 minutes for the yeast to bloom. It's important to check early if your dried yeast is good otherwise your bread won't rise. If there's still no activity in the bowl repeat step 1 with fresh yeast and slightly warmer water.</li>
            <li>Add the wet mix to the dry and start kneading. If you're using a stand mixer set to speed 3. Knead for 8 minutes</li>
            <li>Grease a bread pan with oil or unsalted butter and set aside. On a clean work surface dust with a bit of oat fiber and place your kneaded dough on it. Roll the dough into a log shape then pull and tuck the sides to create a smooth top surface. Pinch the pulled dough on the bottom to create a seam. Now place your finished dough in the bread pan, making sure the seam is facing <em>down</em>. Cover with cling film or a damp towel and leave for 90 minutes in a warm place so it can rise.</li>
            <li>Start preheating your oven to 400F about 15 minutes before your dough is finished rising. When the oven's ready, remove your dough cover and place the pan on the middle rack. Bake for 40-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>After you've taken your bread out let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then remove and leave it on a rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once the bread has cooled down to room temperature, it's ready to be sliced. Enjoy!</li>
